        <p>Bitcoin enthusiast and developer. Currently working on a secure and deniable Bitcoin wallet project called Nowallet. In love with Python and the Web. I advocate for the building and use of distributed systems where control rests with the end users. Networks are powerful. Why should some of us have less power?</p>
